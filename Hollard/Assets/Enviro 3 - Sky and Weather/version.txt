* Fixed an issue and warning with compute buffer may not released correctly.
* Fixed an issue where fog may not rendering correctly when volumetrics are deactivated.
* Fixed some issue with gamma colorspace. (Linear colorspace recommended for realistic lighting!)

* Some code restructuring for Enviro Manager. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v3.0.2

* Fixed an issue in weather inspector when some modules not used.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v3.0.3
 
* Added wind support. Please check the Environment module and clouds modules for settings.

* Enviro will set the sky reflection intensity now based on the global reflection intensity in Built-in and URP and if Update Default Environment Reflections is activated.
* Fixed an issue where Enviro Renderer component was added in URP / HDRP. This could lead to errors when opning prefabs in HDRP. Please remove the Enviro Renderer component from your main cameras!
* Fixed an issue in Unity 2022 where clouds not rendering correctly in builds. (Camera Depth Texture Texel Size not auto set correctly in these cases)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v3.0.4

* Added assetPath string in EnviroHelper script. Change it when you move the Enviro folder to a different folder in your project.
* Added new setting in HDRP to set the skyAmbient mode in your sky module. Set it to "Static" when you want to use static baked lighting.
* Improved volumetric clouds blending. More improvements for this in next updates.
* Improved volumetric clouds detail rendering. 
* Fixed some artifacts with point and spot volumetric lights and fixed an issue with directional volumetrics are not blurred anymore. There will be more improvements in next updates!
* Fixed a possible error with Effect Removal Zones.
* Fixed possible error in metal api with compute buffers not set correctly.
* Fixed an issue with fog/volumetrics in SPI rendering.
* Fixed a bug in Enviro Manager inspector where Flat Clouds and Aurora buttons might be disabled even when not added to the configuration.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v3.0.5

* Added feature to offset clouds position for floating point precision offset systems.
* Added day night switch setting like in Enviro 2.
* Added ChangeCamera function in EnviroManager to quickly change the camera in runtime.
* Added setting to control how often the skybox ambient will be updated.
* Added setting to update lighting not on every frame. Set it to "0" for every frame updates.
* Added flat and cirrus clouds toggles to quality presets.
* Added option in Aurora module to easily deactivated, also added this and steps setting to quality presets.
* Added a sample UI for the sample scenes or your own scenes.  
* Fixed an issue with the SetTimeOfDay function and values over 24.
* Fixed possible flickering issues in HDRP related to reflection probe updates. (Workaround) (This actually might be a HDRP bug related to updating reflection probe/camera on demand together with directional light and sky exposure)
* Fixed and reworked Event UI to correctly support assignement of scene objects.
* Fixed issue where Enviro Effects rendering on all cameras in URP even those that are not assigned. (Fixes preview windows for example)
* Fixed some issues with the HDRP lighting default settings.
* Increased volumetric clouds "travel speed".
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed an issue with Cirrus cloud color set to zero.
* Fixed shader error in HDRP 15+ related to Unity changes.
* Fixed multiple sources that could lead to flickering issues in HDRP.
* Reworked and improved reflection probe handling. Reflections handled now in its own module. This change also fixed some issues related to reflections. 
  Special thanks to fendercodes for their code changes and extensive debugging to improve Enviro! Please check out their game "Hobble": https://store.steampowered.com/app/1761840/Hobble/
